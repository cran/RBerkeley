This package relies on the Oracle Berkeley DB library being present on the system.

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index.html

on debian-ish:

  sudo apt-get install libdb-dev

on os x:

  brew install berkeley-db

CentOS/RedHat require some additional work:

  sudo yum install libdb4-devel

and ensure:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/libdb4
  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/libdb0-04
  export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libdb4

are in the environment before configuring/building
